releaseNotes: >-
  ⚠️ Security Fixes
    - Critical vulnerabilities requiring admin token configuration
    - Admin backend access risks with sendmail and favicon manipulation
    - Multi-organization user privilege exploitation potential


  Key highlights in this release:
    - Updated web-vault to v2025.1.1
    - Added partial manage role support for collections
    - Manager role is converted to a Custom role with either Manage All Collections or per collection. Admins and Owners probably want to check and verify if the rights are still correct.
    - The OCI containers and binaries are signed via GitHub Attestations. This allows you to verify an OCI image or even the vaultwarden binary located within the OCI image.
